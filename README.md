# Intelligent-Traffic-Monitoring-System
This project presents an AI-powered Intelligent Traffic Monitoring System that leverages YOLO-CNN for real-time object detection and MobileNetV5 for lightweight, high-performance classification.
ðŸ§  Key Features
Real-Time Object Detection with YOLO (You Only Look Once) CNN

Efficient Classification using MobileNetV5 for edge devices

Vehicle Counting, Speed Estimation, and Traffic Density Analysis

Violation Detection (e.g., red light running, wrong-way driving)

Supports Live Camera Feeds and Video File Inputs

Optimized for low-latency and resource-constrained environments

ðŸ”§ Tech Stack
YOLO-CNN (YOLOv5 or custom variant)

MobileNetV5 (lightweight deep learning model)

OpenCV for video processing and visualization

PyTorch or TensorFlow (based on implementation)

Flask / Streamlit (optional) for UI dashboard

ðŸ“¦ Use Cases
Smart City Traffic Management

Automated Vehicle Surveillance

Traffic Rule Enforcement Systems

Urban Planning & Traffic Pattern Analysis
